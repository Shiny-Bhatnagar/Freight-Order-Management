- Custom BAdI implementation for cost calculation

Prerequisites

- SAP S/4HANA 2022 or later
- SAP Transportation Management (TM) configured
- ABAP Development 

Deployment

Overview: 

This project implements a shipper scenario where:
1. Freight Units are created based on delivery orders.
2. Freight Orders are planned and scheduled.
3. Custom Logic is used for freight unit assignment and charge calculation.

Process Flow:

1. Sales orders 
2. Freight units are grouped into freight orders based on custom rules.
3. Freight orders are tracked and managed using Fiori.

Configuration Steps: Shipper Scenario


1. Define Freight Order Types:
 - Go to SPRO -> Transportation Management -> Freight Unit Management -> Define Freight Order Types.
 - Create a new Freight Order type 'ZF0T' to manage the lifecycle of your freight orders.

2. Configure Freight Unit Building Rules:
 - Go to SPRO -> Transportation Management -> Freight Unit Management -> Define Freight Unit Building Rules.
 - Create a new Freight Unit Building Rule 'ZFU_RULE' with the following key configurations:
   - Splitting Criteria: Set rules for splitting based on weight, volume, or product category.
   - Grouping Rules: Define how multiple orders/ deliveries should be combined into a single freight unit.
   - Source Object: Map the freight unit creation source to deliveries, orders, or stock transfers.

3. Set Up Freight Unit Types:
 - Navigate to SPRO -> Transportation Management -> Freight Unit Management -> Define Freight Unit Types.
 - Create a Freight Unit type 'ZFUT' and associate it with the building rule 'ZFU_RULE'.

4. Define Freight Unit Creation in Integration Settings:
 - Go to SPRO -> Transportation Management -> Integration -> Define Freight Unit Creation Settings
 - Map the freight unit type 'ZFUT' to the source object (e.g., sales orders or deliveries)
 - Activate the integration so freight units are automatically created when source documents are replicated to SAP TM
I
5. Activate BAdI for Freight Unit Assignment:
 - Implement the 'Z_CUSTOM_FU_ASSIGNMENT' BAdI to customize how Freight Units are assigned to Freight Orders based on specific business rules, such as:
 - Product type
 - Delivery priority
 - Source and destination locations

6. Freight Order Planning and Scheduling:
 - Go to SAP TM Cockpit
 - Use the planning view to drag-and- drop Freight Units into Freight Orders.
 - Configure automated planning by defining optimizer settings under:
   SPRO -> Transportation Management -> Transportation Planning -> Define Planning settings.
